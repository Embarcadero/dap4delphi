# Debug Adapter Protocol for Delphi

The [Debug Adapter Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol/) (DAP) defines the abstract protocol used between a development tool (e.g. IDE or editor) and a debugger. This is an implementation of that protocol in Delphi. 

This is used in the [Python FMX Builder for Android](https://github.com/Embarcadero/PythonFMXBuilder) to allow for debugging of Python applications running on Android. Coming soon to *[PyScripter](https://github.com/Embarcadero/pyscripter)*.
